# **DC Property Modeling Lab**

A unified analytical system for modeling Washington, D.C. real estate data using rigorous statistical methods, Bayesian inference, classical GLMs, and modern machine‑learning engineering practices. The **DC Property Modeling Lab** provides a fully reproducible, modular workflow designed for professional‑grade modeling, diagnostics, and reporting.

The repository now includes **both regression and classification pipelines**, enabling continuous price prediction and price‑tier segmentation within the same end‑to‑end workflow.

The system integrates:

- Classical statistical modeling (GLM, inference, diagnostics, logistic regression)  
- Bayesian hierarchical modeling (Stan, JAGS)  
- Machine‑learning regression pipelines (trees, ensembles, regularization)  
- Machine‑learning classification pipelines (binary, 3‑class, 4‑class)  
- Modular R workflows with optional Python equivalents  
- Automated evaluation, visualization, and reporting  
- A structured ML manual documenting pipeline architecture and modeling methodology  

The goal is to demonstrate **end‑to‑end analytical engineering**, **transparent modeling**, and **reproducible computation** in a single cohesive system.

## **Repository Structure**

The project is organized into four major modeling modules:

```
bayesian/
glm/
pipeline_ml/
standalone_ml/
```

### **bayesian/**
Bayesian hierarchical modeling using Stan and JAGS, including:

- Hierarchical model specification  
- MCMC sampling  
- Posterior inference  
- Convergence diagnostics  
- Posterior predictive checks  

### **glm/**
Classical statistical modeling:

- **Linear regression**  
- **Logistic regression** (binary classification)  
- Regularized regression (ridge, lasso, elastic net)  
- Likelihood‑based inference  
- Diagnostics and interpretability workflows  

GLM models serve as interpretable baselines for both regression and classification tasks.

### **machine_learning_regression/**
Modern ML regression pipelines:

- Decision trees  
- Random forest  
- Bagging  
- PCR / PLS  
- Unified evaluation (MSE, RMSE, MAE, R²)  
- Residual diagnostics and predicted‑vs‑actual plots  

### **pipeline/**
The **end‑to‑end modeling pipeline**, integrating:

- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Train/test splitting  
- Regression models  
- Classification models (binary mean/median)  
- Unified evaluation framework  
- Automated visualization  
- Saved comparison tables  
- Confusion matrices  
- Final reporting (RMarkdown)

This is the operational workflow that runs the entire modeling system via:

## **Classification Pipeline**

The modeling lab now includes full support for **price‑tier classification**, enabling segmentation tasks such as affordability analysis, market tiering, and risk scoring.

### **Supported Classification Tasks**
- **Binary classification**  
  Expensive vs Non‑Expensive (mean/median split)

### **Implemented Algorithms**
- Logistic regression (GLM module)  
- KNN  
- LDA  
- QDA  
- SVM (multiple kernels)

### **Evaluation & Visualization**
- Accuracy  
- Macro‑F1  
- Weighted‑F1  
- Confusion matrices  
- Multi‑class bar charts  
- Unified comparison tables  

Classification is fully integrated into the main pipeline and final report.
